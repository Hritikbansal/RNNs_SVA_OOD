# Binary Classification Objective

Going by [Linzen 2016 et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.01368.pdf) experiments, this repo supports:
* Number Prediction Task 
* Grammaticality Judgement - Our paper only discusses this experiment.  

Network classes are implemented in pytorch.  

## Models

We consider 4 RNN models in our work.

* LSTM
* GRU
* [ONLSTM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.09536) - Ordered Neuron LSTM
* [DRNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08199) - Decay RNN

## Usage
